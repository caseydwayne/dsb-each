dsb-each is "the essential iterator"

  signature:
	  each( [target=this], method, [map=false] )
	
  description:	
    works on objects and arrays ({target}).

    iterates on the target, passing target data thru the supplied method with the parameters ( value, key, index ). 

	notes:
   
	  if a value is returned by the method, it will replace the value in the output object.
  
    if a final boolean of {map} is true, the supplied {target} will receive these values directly.
    otherwise, a same-type object will be created and returned.
